Any software system will ultimately malfunction, and this malfunction might be caused by a variety of different things, including bugs, traffic peaks, security concerns, hardware difficulties, natural disasters, and human error. Failure is common, and it really presents a fantastic opportunity to grow and learn. Any excellent software engineer must learn from their errors in order to prevent future ones.
